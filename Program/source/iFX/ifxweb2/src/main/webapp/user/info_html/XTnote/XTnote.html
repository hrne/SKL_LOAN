<b>Definitions</b><br>
Interest<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amount of interest accrued on an investment.<br>
CouponFactor<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Factor to be used when determining the amount of interest paid by the issuer on coupon payment dates. The periods may be regular or irregular.<br>
CouponRate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interest rate on the security or loan-type agreement, e.g., 5.25%. In the formulas this would be expressed as 0.0525.<br>
Date1 (Y1.M1.D1)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting date for the accrual. It is usually the coupon payment date preceding Date2.<br>
Date2 (Y2.M2.D2)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Date through which interest is being accrued. You could word this as the to date, with Date1 as the from date. For a bond trade, it is the 		    settlement date of the trade.<br>
Date3 (Y3.M3.D3)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coupon payment date following Date2. This would be the maturity date if there are no more interim payments to be made.<br>
Days(StartDate, EndDate)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Function returning the number of days between StartDate and EndDate on a Julian basis (i.e., all days are counted).For instance, Days(15 October2007, 15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;November 2007)returns 31.<br>
EOM<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indicates that the investment always pays interest on the last day of the month. If the investment is not EOM, it will always pay on the same day of the month (e.g., &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the 10th).<br>
Factor<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure representing the amount of the CouponRate to apply in calculating Interest. It is often expressed as days in the accrual period / days in the year.If Date2 is a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;coupon payment date, Factor is zero.<br>
Freq<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coupon payment frequency. 1 = annual, 2 = semi-annual, 4 = quarterly, 12 = monthly, etc.<br>
Principal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Par value of the investment.<br>
For all conventions, the Interest is calculated as:<br>

<b>30/360 methods</span></b><br>
All conventions of this class calculate the Factor as:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=./XTnote2.png><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=./XTnote3.png><br>
This is the same as the Factor calculation, with Date2 replaced by Date3. In the case that it is a regular coupon period, this is equivalent to:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=./XTnote4.png><br>
The conventions are distinguished by the manner in which they adjust Date1 and/or Date2 for the end of the month. Each convention has a set of rules directing the adjustments.<br>
Treating a month as 30 days and a year as 360 days was devised for its ease of calculation by hand compared with manually calculating the actual days between two dates. Also,<br> 
because 360 is highly factorable, payment frequencies of semi-annual and quarterly and monthly will be 180, 90, and 30 days of a 360 day year, 
meaning the payment amount will not change between payment periods.<br>
<br><br>

<b>1.30/360US</b><br>
Date adjustment rules (more than one may take effect; apply them in order, and if a date is changed in one rule the changed value is used in the following rules):<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‧If the investment is EOM and (Date1 is the last day of February) and (Date2 is the last day of February), then change D2 to 30.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‧If the investment is EOM and (Date1 is the last day of February), then change D1 to 30.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‧If D2 is 31 and D1 is 30 or 31, then change D2 to 30.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‧If D1 is 31, then change D1 to 30.<br>
This convention is used for US corporate bonds and many US agency issues. It is most commonly referred to as 30/360, <br>
but the term 30/360 may also refer to any of the other conventions of this class, depending on the context.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‧If D1 is 31, then change D1 to 30.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‧If D2 is 31, then change D2 to 30.<br>

Date adjustment rules:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‧If D1 is the last day of the month, then change D1 to 30.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‧If D2 is the last day of the month (unless Date2 is the maturity date and M2 is February), then change D2 to 30.<br>

Formulas:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=./XTnote7.png><br>
This convention accounts for days in the period based on the portion in a leap year and the portion in a non-leap year.<br>
The days in the numerators are calculated on a Julian day difference basis. In this convention the first day of the period is included and the last day is excluded.<br>

<br><b>6.ACT/ACT澳債</b><br>
1000元面額計算至小數位第二位，第三位後四捨五入到小數第二位。<br>
即 R=1000 * (r / Frequency) * Days between start and end days/ Days in current coupon period<br>
利息=總面額 / 1000 * R<br>

<br><b>7.Actual/360Fixed</b><br>
Formulas:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=./XTnote9.png><br>
Each month is treated normally and the year is assumed to be 365 days. For example, in a period from February 1, 2005 to April 1, 2005, 
the Factor is considered to be 59 days divided by 365.<br>
